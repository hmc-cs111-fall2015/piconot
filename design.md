# Design

## Who is the target for this design, e.g., are you assuming any knowledge on the part of the language users?

Lord of the Rings fans who are moderately well-versed in the lore of the world.

## Why did you choose this design, i.e., why did you think it would be a good idea for users to express the maze-searching computation using this syntax?

Because it is fun (we are LotR fans) and because it also provides essentially equivalent functionality without major changes to the program model.

## What behaviors are easier to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design?  If there are no such behaviors, why not?

None.  We essentially took the existing syntax and made it more verbose.  Yay!

## What behaviors are more difficult to express in your design than in Picobot’s original design? If there are no such behaviors, why not?

None of them are more difficult conceptually, they simply require more verbosity (which may be easier for some people, because it is more clear what is happening).

## On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is “very different”), how different is your syntax from PicoBot’s original design?

4. It uses different words but equivalent grammar to express the same concepts.

## Is there anything you don’t like about your design?

So verbose.  Painfully so.
